# Video Processing Scheduler
This project schedules the processing of multiple videos based on their arrival and burst
times using the Shortest-Job First (SJF) Non-Preemptive scheduling algorithm. The goal
is to minimize the average turnaround time and waiting time, thereby optimizing the
efficiency of the video processing system.
